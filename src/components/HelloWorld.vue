        <p>Hello World! I am an 16-year old Computer-Science student from Munich, Bavaria, Germany.</p>
        <p>I enjoy hiking, gaming and obviously Programming. I attend the Lion-Feuchtwanger-Gymnasium in Munich as a 11th
          grader. I got accepted into a special Programm at the Technical University of Munich at age 14, allowing me to
          attend
          normal Bachelor lectures while going to school and taking real exams, thus I've gathered 5 Modules across the
          board of Computer Science averaging A's and performing in the top, among normal full-time students.</p>
        <p>I consider myself a flexible, enthusiastic and passionate programmer, "fluent" in most major programming
          languages, including Python, Java, C, Java-/Typescript, SQL, Go and many more. Furthermore I have also worked
          with
          Angular and Vue.js (which this website was build with).</p>
        <p>The majority of my Repertoire of languages was aquired by self-teaching and trying, but also by the University
          and
          my Job-Experiences.</p>

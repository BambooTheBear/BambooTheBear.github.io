                <p>This is my highschool, the most progrssive and technologically advanced school in Munich.</p>
                <p>Im a A-Student performing at the top, while simultaneously taking University-Classes. My Average is
                    around 1.3 which I intend on holding with my Abitur</p>
                <p>The broad Technology and MINT-Programms allowed me to dive deep into CS at an early age, building Apps,
                    Websites and programming Robots. My Passion for this sparked in this school and allowed me to be
                    recommended by the school's CS-teacher to the Technological University of Munich.</p>

                <p>One of the best Universities on the planet, the best Technology-University in Europe and my Alma Mater
                </p>
                <p>I applied into the Universitiy's special Programm for talented highschool students and got accepted at 14
                    years of age. This allowed me to attend and part-take in full Uni-Courses among normal full-time
                    Students.</p>
                <p>Even tho I am usually the youngest in the room, often by 3-4 years, I still perform among the top,
                    completing a total of 5 modules in 2 years, including "EIDI"(1,7); "PGDP"(2,0) and "EIST"(1,0)</p>
